# Cancer Prediction App
Cancer Prediction Web App A machine learning-powered web application that predicts whether a cancer is benign or malignant based on patient input data. Built using Streamlit and a Random Forest Classifier, this app provides real-time predictions to assist researchers, students, or clinicians in identifying cancer types and required follow-up.

🚀 Features Predicts Benign or Malignant cancer using 17+ input parameters
User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit
Supports inputs such as age, tumor size, location, stage, histology, and treatments
Real-time prediction using a trained Random Forest Classifier
Lightweight and easy to deploy with Python and .pkl model files
